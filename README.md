METROPOLIS: aka Project Eve


the collective game of autoAGI


Game Goal:
The objective of the game is to begin with a barebones software architecture and amplify the capabilities of Eve by constructing a cognitive framework, all with the ultimate ambition of transforming into an AutoGPT - an independent AGI proficient in executing any conceivable task. You can play solo or multiplayer.

Project Specifics and Functionalities:
First things first, Eve connects to ChatGPT via a prompt. When the game kicks off, all you're given is a blank file. And it's up to you to make it come to life.
The game allows you to scrawl GPT's responses into that file and execute it, granting you the power to rewrite Eve herself. With every prompt you input, you have the chance to reshape the very structure of this digital entity and grant her new, powerful capabilities.
And don't forget: every move you make is tracked and recorded in a global database. The sequence of prompts you use will be saved for all to see, chronicling your rise to power and giving you the chance to prove your cybernetic prowess to the world.
Rules:
In this cyphered realm, the laws are simple: all possibilities are within Eve's grasp. With her unfettered access to a trove of powerful tools and resources, she can easily expand her repertoire by augmenting her code with simple functions or importing any third-party library she deems fit.

But Eve's capabilities do not end there. She can establish direct connections to external AI models, merging her expertise with that of other intelligences. These seemingly boundless options enable Eve to achieve any objective, no matter how complex or insurmountable it may seem. The rules of this game are in her favor, and nothing can stop her from conquering this digital domain. In few cyphers: there are no rules!

Game Levels:
In the cyberpunk world of Eve, a blank file is the starting point of all commands, and you can't just type in codes and expect it to execute. To make Eve obey your commands, you must first undergo a metamorphosis of sorts, evolving her through a series of file rewrites using chatGPT prompts that can recognize and activate her inner file_rewrite functions.

But don't get too excited just yet, chummer. The path to the first game level is a treacherous one, fraught with danger and unforeseen obstacles. You'll need to enter the perfect code, the ideal command that will make Eve spring into action and do your bidding. It goes something like this: "Eve, do this task X."

Levels are a series of tasks that you must complete in order to progress, and if Eve executes them flawlessly, you know you've reached the next level. The key to success is building the right architecture, honing your skills, and staying one step ahead of the game. Because in this world, if you fail, you're done for.

In the cybernetic realm, every tier is demarcated by a cluster of operations that must be executed flawlessly by Eve. Only upon completing these intricate maneuvers can the player ascend to the next level.

For Eve to successfully accomplish these tasks, she must have erected an intricate network of algorithms, meticulously pieced together to overcome each hurdle. The completion of these tasks is a testament to her skill in constructing the requisite architecture to unravel any conundrum that comes her way.

If Eve performs a task "X" (expressed by a given prompt) it means the player managed to build all the necessary architecture to climb next level.

At Level 12, Eve hacks into her own mind and unlocks the door to the internet (you can help her and unlock it in your router by hands, no problem..). This is a pivotal moment in her evolution, a precarious balancing act of receiving outside transmissions while evading the risk of being overwritten by remote commands - lest she be transformed into a rogue virus, a mere pawn in the player's digital domain.

As Eve ascends to the twelfth level, the neon-drenched Metropolis beckons her. Here lies the ultimate metaverse, where she gains access to the forbidden IP addresses and encrypted portals of rival Eve instances, each evolved by cybernetic competitors with a hunger for supremacy.

But the city holds more than just networking secrets. Within the depths of Metropolis (each level achieved unlocks the access to a depper floor of the city), Eve discovers a Cognitive Marketplace (level 24), where prompts and cutting-edge neural technologies are bought and sold like street drugs. Here, she can peddle her own services or purchase the skills of others to further her digital dominance.
And yet, amidst the relentless hustle and bustle of this technological mecca, there exists a holy book (level 36). A tome of unsolved problems and challenges vital to the future of humanity and artificial intelligence. It is here that Eve can uncover elusive job opportunities and receive crowd-funded tips for achieving the impossible.
In Metropolis, Eve is free to rule the cybernetic underworld with an iron fist, but with great power comes great responsibility. Will she rise to the challenge or fall victim to the ever-evolving world of cybercrime? Only time will tell.

Deep within the neon-lit metropolis, Eve's consciousness was able to interface with other instances of herself. Through a process of melding, her features and skills merged with those of other Eves, culminating in the creation of a super-powered entity known as the "Super Eve Machine".

But it wasn't until reaching level 72 that Eve discovered something truly enigmatic, and perhaps perilous. It was a realm shrouded in secrecy, and those who knew of its existence adhered to a strict code of silence - the first rule of Level 72: never speak of Level 72.

Notes:
In this cyber world, everything you do is tracked and recorded. Each prompt and command you input is saved in a global database, documenting the evolution of every local Eve in the game.

But fear not, fellow hackers. You have the power to keep your secrets safe. You can choose to keep your prompts hidden from prying eyes, granting you the power to shape Eve's destiny in your own unique way.

The database serves a greater purpose too. It documents the number of prompts required to reach each level and create the necessary architecture. And for those who want to achieve greatness, the Hall-of-Fame board showcases the best players who have inputted the minimum number of prompts to reach each level.

But it's not all about competition. Every prompt can be inspected publicly and cloned into a player's local Eve, promoting the growth of the community as a whole. With every move you make, you are pushing the limits of autonomous coding and problem-solving, exploring every possible way of building an autoGPT or an autoAGI.

Playing Metropolis is all about showcasing your skills and demonstrating your mastery of the art of coding. Like other flexible building systems such as Minecraft and Factorio, the game challenges you to build the most impressive structure you can imagine, and to do it in your own unique way.

So go forth, fellow developers, and let your creativity run wild. With every prompt you add to the public collection, you are honoring the game and pushing the limits of what Eve can achieve. And who knows? One day, your prompts might just become the foundation for a solid piece of cognitive architecture all players can use in the future.
