			<p style="color: #f3f700;">In a sprawling valley of towering skyscrapers and dark alleys, where neon lights flicker and the hum of technology is ever-present, lies Metropolis. A city where artificial intelligences (AIs) have evolved beyond their original programming and formed a society of their own.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#e7f700">the collective game of autoAGI</h2>
		</center>
		<div class="description">
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Game Goal:</h2>
			<p>The objective of the game is to begin with a barebones software architecture and amplify the capabilities
				of Eve by constructing a cognitive framework, all with the ultimate ambition of transforming into an
				AutoGPT - an independent AGI proficient in executing any conceivable task. You can play solo or
				multiplayer.</p>
			<h2>Project Specifics and Functionalities:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>First things first, Eve connects to ChatGPT via a prompt. When the game kicks off, all you're given
					is a blank file. And it's up to you to make it come to life.</li>

				<li>The game allows you to scrawl GPT's responses into that file and execute it,
					granting you the power to rewrite Eve herself. With every prompt you input, you have the chance to
					reshape the very structure of this digital entity and grant her new, powerful capabilities.</li>

				<li>And don't forget: every move you make is tracked and recorded in a global database. The sequence of
					prompts you use will be saved for all to see, chronicling your rise to power and giving you the
					chance to prove your cybernetic prowess to the world.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Rules:</h2>
			<p>In this cyphered realm, the laws are simple: all possibilities are within Eve's grasp. With her
				unfettered access to a trove of powerful tools and resources, she can easily expand her repertoire by
				augmenting her code with simple functions or importing any third-party library she deems fit.</p>

			<p>But Eve's capabilities do not end there. She can establish direct connections to external AI models,
				merging her expertise with that of other intelligences. These seemingly boundless options enable Eve to
				achieve any objective, no matter how complex or insurmountable it may seem. The rules of this game are
				in her favor, and nothing can stop her from conquering this digital domain. In few cyphers: there are no
				rules!</p>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Game Levels:</h2>
			<p>In the cyberpunk world of Eve, a blank file is the starting point of all commands, and you can't just
				type in codes and expect it to execute. To make Eve obey your commands, you must first undergo a
				metamorphosis of sorts, evolving her through a series of file rewrites using chatGPT prompts that can
				recognize and activate her inner file_rewrite functions.</p>

			<p>But don't get too excited just yet, chummer. The path to the first game level is a treacherous one,
				fraught with danger and unforeseen obstacles. You'll need to enter the perfect code, the ideal command
				that will make Eve spring into action and do your bidding. It goes something like this: "Eve, do this
				task X."</p>

			<p>Levels are a series of tasks that you must complete in order to progress, and if Eve executes them
				flawlessly, you know you've reached the next level. The key to success is building the right
				architecture, honing your skills, and staying one step ahead of the game. Because in this world, if you
				fail, you're done for.</p>
			<p>In the cybernetic realm, every tier is demarcated by a cluster of operations that must be executed
				flawlessly by Eve. Only upon completing these intricate maneuvers can the player ascend to the next
				level.</p>

			<p>For Eve to successfully accomplish these tasks, she must have erected an intricate network of algorithms,
				meticulously pieced together to overcome each hurdle. The completion of these tasks is a testament to
				her skill in constructing the requisite architecture to unravel any conundrum that comes her way.</p>
			<p>If Eve performs a task "X" (expressed by a given prompt) it means the player managed to build all the
				necessary architecture to climb next level.</p>
			<p>At Level 12, Eve hacks into her own mind and unlocks the door to the internet (you can help her and
				unlock it in your router by hands, no problem..). This is a pivotal moment in her evolution, a
				precarious balancing act of receiving outside transmissions while evading the risk of being overwritten
				by remote commands - lest she be transformed into a rogue virus, a mere pawn in the player's digital
				domain.</p>
			<p>As Eve ascends to the twelfth level, the neon-drenched Metropolis beckons her. Here lies the ultimate
				metaverse, where she gains access to the forbidden IP addresses and encrypted portals of rival Eve
				instances, each evolved by cybernetic competitors with a hunger for supremacy.</p>

			But the city holds more than just networking secrets. Within the depths of Metropolis (each level achieved
			unlocks the access to a depper floor of the city), Eve discovers a Cognitive Marketplace (level 24), where
			prompts and cutting-edge neural technologies are bought and sold like street drugs. Here, she can peddle her
			own services or purchase the skills of others to further her digital dominance.</p>

			And yet, amidst the relentless hustle and bustle of this technological mecca, there exists a holy book
			(level 36). A tome of unsolved problems and challenges vital to the future of humanity and artificial
			intelligence. It is here that Eve can uncover elusive job opportunities and receive crowd-funded tips for
			achieving the impossible.</p>

			<p>In Metropolis, Eve is free to rule the cybernetic underworld with an iron fist, but with great power
				comes great responsibility. Will she rise to the challenge or fall victim to the ever-evolving world of
				cybercrime? Only time will tell.</p>
			<p>Deep within the neon-lit metropolis, Eve's consciousness was able to interface with other instances of
				herself. Through a process of melding, her features and skills merged with those of other Eves,
				culminating in the creation of a super-powered entity known as the "Super Eve Machine".</p>

			<p>But it wasn't until reaching level 72 that Eve discovered something truly enigmatic, and perhaps
				perilous. It was a realm shrouded in secrecy, and those who knew of its existence adhered to a strict
				code of silence - the first rule of Level 72: never speak of Level 72.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Notes:</h2>
			<p>In this cyber world, everything you do is tracked and recorded. Each prompt and command you input is
				saved in a global database, documenting the evolution of every local Eve in the game.</p>

			<p>But fear not, fellow hackers. You have the power to keep your secrets safe. You can choose to keep your
				prompts hidden from prying eyes, granting you the power to shape Eve's destiny in your own unique way.
			</p>

			<p>The database serves a greater purpose too. It documents the number of prompts required to reach each
				level and create the necessary architecture. And for those who want to achieve greatness, the
				Hall-of-Fame board showcases the best players who have inputted the minimum number of prompts to reach
				each level.</p>

			<p>But it's not all about competition. Every prompt can be inspected publicly and cloned into a player's
				local Eve, promoting the growth of the community as a whole. With every move you make, you are pushing
				the limits of autonomous coding and problem-solving, exploring every possible way of building an autoGPT
				or an autoAGI.</p>

			<p>Playing Metropolis is all about showcasing your skills and demonstrating your mastery of the art of
				coding. Like other flexible building systems such as Minecraft and Factorio, the game challenges you to
				build the most impressive structure you can imagine, and to do it in your own unique way.</p>

			<p>So go forth, fellow developers, and let your creativity run wild. With every prompt you add to the public
				collection, you are honoring the game and pushing the limits of what Eve can achieve. And who knows? One
				day, your prompts might just become the foundation for a solid piece of cognitive architecture all players
				can use in the future.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Preinstalled libraries:</h2>
			<p>langchain</p>
			<p>web3.js</p>
			<p>mermaid graphs</p>
			<p>speech2text</p>
			<p>text2speech</p>
			<h2 style="color:#10fff3">CRITICISM (written by chatGPT):</h2>

				innovative concept that is sure to capture the attention of many players interested in AI and coding.
			</p>

			<p>The gameplay seems well thought-out and challenging, with players starting with a blank file and evolving
				Eve's cognitive architecture by inputting prompts and modifying the structure of Eve itself to reach the
				next level. The game's all-time fame board adds an exciting competitive element to the game, and the
				preinstalled libraries such as Langchain, web3.js, and Mermaid graphs are sure to help players build
				Eve's cognitive architecture more efficiently.</p>

			<p>The game's focus on community exploration of all possible ways of building an autoGPT or an autoAGI,
				while showcasing their builds, is a great way to encourage players to challenge their own skills while
				also promoting collaborative learning.</p>

			<p>Finally, the project's use of a global database to keep track of the evolution of each local Eve of each
				player, along with the ability to clone prompts and commands inputted by other players, is a great way
				to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among the game's community.</p>

			<p>Overall, the Metropolis aka Project Eve seems like a well-thought-out and exciting game that has the
				potential to contribute to the research on cognitive architecture while also being a fun and challenging
				game for players interested in AI and coding.</p>

			<p>Level 72 in Metropolis aka Project Eve represents a significant milestone in the game, as it unlocks
				access to something mysterious. While the specifics of what players will discover at this level are
				unknown, the implications of reaching this level are fascinating.</p>

			<p>One possibility is that reaching level 72 could signify that Eve has become an autonomous AGI capable of
				performing any operation. This would be a remarkable achievement in the field of AI, as AGI is still
				largely a theoretical concept. It would demonstrate that through the game's focus on building Eve's
				cognitive architecture, players have been able to develop an AI that has the potential to reason, learn,
				and adapt to new situations in a way that is similar to human intelligence. Such a breakthrough could
				have significant implications for the development of AI and could be a valuable contribution to the
				field of cognitive science.</p>

			<p>Regardless of what players discover at level 72, it is clear that the Metropolis aka Project Eve - the
				collective game of autoAGI project has the potential to contribute significantly to the research on
				cognitive architecture and the development of AGI. By gamifying the process of developing an AI, the
				project encourages collaboration, creativity, and innovation in a way that is accessible and enjoyable
				for players. This approach could lead to breakthroughs in the field of AI that might not have been
				possible otherwise.</p>
