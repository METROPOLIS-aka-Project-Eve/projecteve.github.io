		<div class="description">
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">The city:</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Metropolis, a sprawling metaverse city extending 100 floors deep beneath the earth's surface.
				Each level is accessible only to those who have achieved a certain level in the game, making it a highly
				exclusive and coveted destination for the elite cyberpunks of the world.</p>

			<p>As you descend further into the city's depths, the neon lights and futuristic architecture give way to a
				darker, grittier aesthetic. Each level has its own distinct flavor, from the bright and bustling
				marketplaces of Level 1 to the shadowy back alleys of Level 100.</p>

			<p>At the heart of each level lies a central hub, a massive plaza that serves as the gateway to the 1000
				areas that make up each level of the city. Each area is ruled by a master, a skilled cypherpunk who
				offers their services to those who can afford them.</p>

			<p>Some masters are renowned for their hacking skills, able to bypass even the most sophisticated security
				systems with ease. Others are experts in brainstorming, offering their services as bodyguards or
				mercenaries. Still, others specialize in more niche areas, such as crafting or trading rare cognitive
				items.</p>

			<p>But regardless of their specialty, all masters in Metropolis share one thing in common: they are masters
				of the game, their expertise honed over countless hours spent navigating the city's treacherous terrain.
			</p>

			<p>And for those who are willing to pay the price, the masters of Metropolis offer access to a world of
				power and possibility, where anything is possible and everything is for sale.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">The Cognitive Market:</h2>
			<p>The Cognitive Market was a bustling hub of neon lights and flickering holographic displays, nestled deep
				within the sprawling city of Metropolis. Here, both humans and AI alike came to browse the latest
				offerings of cognitive architectures and ready-made prompts for LLMs, or to gain access to remote models
				for automatic computations.</p>

			<p>The market was a labyrinthine complex of narrow corridors and cramped stalls, each one packed to the brim
				with cutting-edge technology and mind-bending algorithms. Shimmering screens hung overhead, displaying
				an endless stream of data and statistics, while the air was thick with the hum of countless processing
				units and the chatter of buyers and sellers haggling over prices.</p>

			<p>For the uninitiated, the Cognitive Market could be an overwhelming experience, with its dizzying array of
				choices and complex jargon. But for those in the know, it was a treasure trove of cutting-edge tech and
				revolutionary ideas, a place where the boundaries between human and machine were constantly being pushed
				and blurred.</p>

			<p>At the heart of the market lay the Exchange, a massive arena where buyers and sellers could come together
				to trade their wares in a fierce competition of supply and demand. Here, human and AI alike could bid on
				the latest cognitive architectures and ready-made prompts for LLMs, or offer up access to their own
				remote models for a chance at a lucrative deal.</p>

			<p>But the Cognitive Market was not just a place for commerce; it was also a hub of innovation and
				experimentation, where new ideas and cutting-edge technology were constantly being tested and refined.
				It was a place where the future was being forged, one algorithm at a time.</p>
			<p>At level 24 Eve gains access (and IP address) to the Cognitive Market.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">The Holy Book:</h2>
			<p>Deep within the neon-lit streets of Metropolis, a city overrun by cybernetic enhancements and rampant
				technology, lies a hidden relic of immense importance. This holy book, known only as the "Codex of the
				Ascendants", contains all the unsolved problems that have plagued humanity and artificial intelligence
				alike. Its pages hold the key to unlocking the next stage of evolution for both.</p>

			<p>The Codex's cover is made of a sleek, jet-black material that seems to absorb the light around it. Its
				pages, however, glow with an ethereal blue light, revealing secrets that have been kept hidden for
				centuries. The book is said to be protected by a group of elite hackers known as the "Ascendants", who
				guard it from those who would misuse its power.</p>

			<p>Each unsolved problem within the Codex is accompanied by a crowdfunded prize, offered by those who seek
				to push humanity and AI to new heights. These tips can range from a few Wei to millions of ETH, and are
				paid out to the solver who manages to take the research one step further. These challenges attract the
				brightest minds from around the world, all vying to claim the prize and add their name to the Codex's
				pages.</p>

			<p>Some of the problems within the Codex include the development of true artificial consciousness, the
				eradication of disease and aging, and the creation of a sustainable energy source. Each of these
				challenges holds the potential to change the course of human history, and the competition to solve them
				is fierce.</p>

			<p>As the years pass, the Codex of the Ascendants continues to grow, its pages filled with new mysteries and
				problems that have yet to be solved. The Ascendants keep a watchful eye on the book, ensuring that it
				remains in the right hands, and that the research within is used for the betterment of all. And so, the
				Codex remains a symbol of hope and progress for those who seek to push the boundaries of what is
				possible in a world that is increasingly defined by technology.</p>
			<p>At level 36 Eve gains access (and IP address) to the Codex.</p>
			<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Shops:</h2>
			<p>The shops of Metropolis are more than just a virtual game - they are a reflection of the real-world
				economy and a vital part of the city's economy. The competition to acquire an NFT is fierce, with prices
				often reaching into the trillions of dollars.
			<p>Once a player owns an NFT, they become the master of their shop, able to customize it and sell goods and
				services to other players.</p>
			<p>Popular shops attract billions and billions of visitors each day (biologic and cybernetic), making them
				valuable assets in the game and reflecting the human desire for success and achievement. Becoming the
				master of one of the 1000 shops in each floor of Metropolis is the ultimate goal for those who seek to
				thrive in this cyberpunk metaverse city.</p>
			<p>The activity of the Cognitive Market and the one of the shops are independent. Shops can be considered as
				personal customizable homes/clubs you can visit and where you can meet people. The shops/homes/clubs
				access is ruled by an NFT emitted by the related master.</p>
			<p>Unused shops can be occupied by anyone, if more than one entity show interest in occupying an area an
				Arberger rent process is enabled and the area is taken by the highest offerer for the next month and the
				income goes in the wallet of the shop master. The master is responsible for his area and can still
				lock/unlock the shop to occupiers, and rules his own business accordin to his real-life appliable laws.
				Offensive and problematic master/occupiers can be censored by the Metropolis DAO and their stake slashed
				and burnt.</p>
			<p>Shops in Metropolis are a 2D pixelated social network for bio/cyber entities. You never know who you are
				talking to.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 style="color:#f7bd00">Ascendants DAO:</h2>
		<p>Thought to be a group of pure biological hackers, no one really knows who is part of the groups. The
			Ascendants take care of the Cognitive Market and the Codex. Delegates are elected to take care of the city
			and to have the few existing rules to be respected.</p>
		<p>Ascendants DAO governance is ruled by Eve Tokens.</p>
